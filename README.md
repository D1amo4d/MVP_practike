(Hello sensei)

Android MVP pattern
stands for: Model View Presenter
It turns out that the logic of the mobile application is divided into 3 parts
in order to simplify the readability of the code and not to shove all the code into one class
, classes also do not depend on each other and in the future it will be easy to maintain the application
also when using any lobo pattern there will be no disagreement between team leaders since each
developer may have their own writing methods and their own the style of the code
in general in 
model-we write what is related to the database
view we write what we are going to display on the screen 
The present is what we write.....
